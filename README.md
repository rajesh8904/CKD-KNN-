# CKD Prediction Using Data Science Techniques  

## 📄 Project Overview  
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a critical global health issue, affecting approximately 10% of the population. Early detection and prediction of CKD can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict CKD based on medical data, providing doctors with faster and more accurate diagnostic tools.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Predict CKD using machine learning and data science techniques.  
- Automate CKD detection to assist medical professionals.  
- Develop a real-time web-based application for use in hospitals and clinics.  

## 🔍 Scope  
- **Domain**: Healthcare – CKD detection and prediction.  
- **Technology**: .NET for application development, SQL Server for data storage.  
- **Users**: Doctors, Receptionists, and Patients.  
- **Model**: Utilizes the Naive Bayes Algorithm for classification and prediction.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Frontend**: ASP.NET  
- **Backend**: SQL Server  
- **Programming Language**: C#  
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio  
- **Data Mining**: Python for preprocessing and model development  

## 📋 Functional Requirements  
- Admin Module:  
  - Manage user accounts (doctors/receptionists).  
  - Upload CKD parameters and datasets.  
- Doctor Module:  
  - Input patient parameters for CKD prediction.  
  - Upload and manage treatment details.  
- Receptionist Module:

## 🚀 Implementation  
- **Algorithm**: Naive Bayes for CKD classification based on 24 parameters.  
- **Dataset**: Collected from UCI Machine Learning Repository and other verified sources.  
- **Prediction Flow**:  
  1. Upload patient data.  
  2. Apply Naive Bayes algorithm.  
  3. Generate prediction results for CKD diagnosis.  

## 🧪 Testing  
- Conducted unit testing and system testing for all modules.  
- Validated the system with real-world CKD datasets.  

## 📷 Snapshots  
- Screenshots of login pages, prediction interfaces, and data upload modules included.  

## 📈 Future Enhancements  
- Integration with other medical systems.  
- Implementing additional machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy.  
- Expansion to predict other chronic diseases.
